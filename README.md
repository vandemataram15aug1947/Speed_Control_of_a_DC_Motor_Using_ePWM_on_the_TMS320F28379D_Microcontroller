# Speed Control of a DC Motor Using ePWM on the TMS320F28379D Microcontroller

## Description
This project implements **closed-loop speed control** of a **DC motor** using **PWM signals** generated by the **TMS320F28379D** microcontroller. A **PID controller** adjusts the duty cycle based on feedback from an **encoder**.

## Features
- **PWM-based speed control**
- **PID closed-loop regulation**
- **Encoder feedback for real-time speed monitoring**

## Getting Started

### **1. Hardware Requirements**
- **TMS320F28379D LaunchPad**
- **DC Motor with Encoder**
- **Motor Driver Circuit (e.g., L293D, DRV8871)**
- **Power Supply for the Motor**

### **2. Software Requirements**
- **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**
- **C2000Ware (for TMS320F28379D support)**

# GPIO Connections and Potentiometer Setup

## GPIO Connection Table

| S. No | GPIO Pin   | Launchpad Pin | Component  |
|------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1    | ADCINA0    | Pin 30       | Potentiometer |
| 2    | GPIO0      | EPWM1A (Pin 40) | Oscilloscope |
| 3    | GPIO0      | Connected to Relay | Motor |

## Connecting the Potentiometer

Follow these steps to correctly connect the potentiometer to the **TMS320**:

1. Connect the **negative pin** of the potentiometer to **GND PIN** on the TMS320.
2. Connect the **signal pin** of the potentiometer to **ADCINA0** on the TMS320.
3. Connect the **positive pin** of the potentiometer to **5V PIN** on the TMS320.

## About the Potentiometer

A **potentiometer** is a three-terminal electrical and electronic component that can change its resistance by rotating or statically moving. It is commonly used for voltage division or as a variable resistor.

### Configuration Modes
The potentiometer can be used in two primary configurations:
1. **Voltage Control Mode:** The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider, providing an adjustable voltage output.
2. **Resistance Control Mode:** The potentiometer alters its resistance dynamically, depending on the rotation or movement.

This setup is useful for applications such as analog signal control, sensor calibration, and user input interfaces.
