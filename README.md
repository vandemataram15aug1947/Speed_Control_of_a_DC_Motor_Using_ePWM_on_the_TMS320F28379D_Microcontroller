# GPIO Connections and Potentiometer Setup

## GPIO Connection Table

| SL. No | GPIO Pin   | Launchpad Pin | Name of the Component  |
|------|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1    | ADCINA0    | Pin 30       | Potentiometer |
| 2    | GPIO0      | EPWM1A (Pin 40) | Oscilloscope |

## Connecting the Potentiometer

Follow these steps to correctly connect the potentiometer to the **TMS320F28379D**:

1. Connect the **Negative Pin** of the potentiometer to **GND PIN** on the TMS320.
2. Connect the **Signal Pin** of the potentiometer to **ADCINA0** on the TMS320.
3. Connect the **Positive Pin** of the potentiometer to **5V PIN** on the TMS320.

## About the Potentiometer  

The **potentiometer** is used to adjust the **PWM duty cycle** through the **TMS320F28379D's Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**, thereby directly controlling the **motor speed**. As the potentiometer's position changes, the ADC reads the corresponding voltage, which is then used to modify the PWM signal and regulate the motor speed dynamically.  

### How It Works  
- Rotating the **potentiometer** increases or decreases the ADC value.  
- A **higher ADC value** results in a **lower duty cycle**, causing the motor to **slow down or stop**.  
- A **lower ADC value** increases the duty cycle, allowing the motor to **run at full speed**.  
- The motor speed is continuously adjusted based on the potentiometerâ€™s position.  

### Potentiometer Overview  
A **potentiometer** is a **three-terminal electrical component** that can change its **resistance** either by rotating or through linear motion. It is commonly used in circuits for **voltage division** or as a **variable resistor**.  

Below is the circuit diagram illustrating how the **potentiometer is connected to the TMS320F28379D** for motor speed control:

This setup ensures smooth and precise **DC motor speed control**, making it a fundamental part of this project. ðŸš€  

### Configuration Modes
The potentiometer can be used in two primary configurations:
1. **Voltage Control Mode:** The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider, providing an adjustable voltage output.
2. **Resistance Control Mode:** The potentiometer alters its resistance dynamically, depending on the rotation or movement.

This setup is useful for applications such as analog signal control, sensor calibration, and user input interfaces.
