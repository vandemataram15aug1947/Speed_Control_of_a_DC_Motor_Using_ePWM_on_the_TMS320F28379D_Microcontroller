## Connecting the Potentiometer

Follow these steps to correctly connect the potentiometer to the **TMS320F28379D**:

1. Connect the **Negative Pin** of the potentiometer to **GND PIN** on the TMS320.
2. Connect the **Signal Pin** of the potentiometer to **ADCINA0** on the TMS320.
3. Connect the **Positive Pin** of the potentiometer to **5V PIN** on the TMS320.

## About the Potentiometer

A **potentiometer** is a three-terminal electrical and electronic component that can change its resistance by rotating or statically moving. It is commonly used for voltage division or as a variable resistor.

### Configuration Modes
The potentiometer can be used in two primary configurations:
1. **Voltage Control Mode:** The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider, providing an adjustable voltage output.
2. **Resistance Control Mode:** The potentiometer alters its resistance dynamically, depending on the rotation or movement.

This setup is useful for applications such as analog signal control, sensor calibration, and user input interfaces.

# Hardware Used

## 10K Ohm 3-Pin 15mm Shaft Potentiometer
The **10K Ohm 3-Pin 15mm Shaft Potentiometer** is a versatile component used for adjusting various parameters like voltage and current in an electronic circuit. When turned or slid halfway, its resistance is halfway between its minimum and maximum settings, making it ideal for applications such as dimmer controls, fan speed adjustments, and more.

For audio applications, logarithmic potentiometers are preferred over linear ones since they better match the human ear's nonlinear response to sound. A log potentiometer increases resistance exponentially, ensuring that volume changes appear more uniform to human perception. In contrast, a linear potentiometer used for volume control would result in large variations in loudness at lower levels and minor changes at higher levels.
